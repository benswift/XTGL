# libXTGL

libXTGL is a cross-platform OpenGL context and window management
library which was previously part of
[Extempore](http://extempore.moso.com.au) (e**XT**empore **GL**
library).

This code has since been stripped out of the Extempore executable, and
so now if you want to create OpenGL contexts then you can use this
library (or any other window/context management library).

If you have any issues using this library in Extempore, check out the
[Extempore Docs](http://benswift.me/extempore-docs) or hit us up on
the [Extempore mailing list](mailto:extemporelang@googlegroups.com).
